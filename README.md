# My_introduction
On April 30, 2025, I lost my GitHub account that I had built up over 5 years since 2019 due to certain US policy reasons. Since I never imagined I would be suspended, and my appeal was ignored, I lost 90% of my previous projects and materials. Out of trust in GitHub, I didn't keep many local backups. This is my new account.
