# My_introduction
On April 30, 2025, I lost my GitHub account that I had built up over 5 years since 2019 due to certain US policy reasons. Since I never imagined I would be suspended, and my appeal was ignored, I lost 90% of my previous projects and materials. Out of trust in GitHub, I didn't keep many local backups. This is my new account.

It's also possible that my account was suspended due to being hacked. However, despite multiple appeals, I have yet to receive any response from GitHub. Because of this, I've decided to upload what code I still have saved locally. 

For sharing my future code, I'll focus more on video tutorials, images, and articles. After all, losing a 5-year-old account has caused me significant losses.
